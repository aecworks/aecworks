# 2. Content Quality

**aec.works** it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every AEC company â€“ rather, it is a selected list of companies our editors consider fresh and exciting.

It should be a place people go to to discover disruptive products and who is innovating in different spheres of the AEC industry.

This goal of this document is to outline general guidelines about what should be included, and give our community of editors a decision-making baseline.

## Entries

The website is built to showcase primarily:

* AEC Startups
* AEC Open Source Projects
* AEC Product-Centric Companies 

While there are exceptions, we generally want to steer away from:

1. General Purpose Tools \(Airtable, Figma, Illustrator\)
2. Well known AEC Tools and Desktop apps \(Revit, Solibri, Sketchup\)
3. Platform Specific Plugins and Add-ins \(eg. Revit and Rhino plugins\)
4. Companies providing "traditional" AEC Service \(Architecture Offices, Engineers, Contractors, Subs, etc\)
5. Consultants

The guidelines above - in particular 3, 4, and 5 - can be broken at your discretion if they stand out among competitors and seem especially exciting.

## Signals

Once we have decided an entry is generally suitable, we want to also make sure it's "high quality".

Ultimately, we want people to be excited about what they see.

Thinking about these signals might help:

### Signals of a Good Entry

* You are excited about it
* It's innovative
* It's sleek

### Signals of a Bad Entry

* There many others like it
* Brand or website don't feel exciting
* You wouldn't be excited talking about it with a colleague
